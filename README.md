# DeleteFirefoxCache

Deletes all the Firefox cache for every user on a Windows computer<br />
Great way to free up space on Terminal Servers and other computers with multiple Windows users<br /><br />

Cache is stored on the local computer in the directory C:\Users\\%user%\AppData\Local\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles<br />
A Windows user can have multiple Firefox profiles; profiles can be found in the above directory or by<br />
going to 'about:profiles' in a Firefox browser (type that in the address bar, without the single quotes)
